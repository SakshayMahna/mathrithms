# Overview
This is a research project which aims to create a mathematical library for the C++ language, on the lines of NumPy and SciPy present in Python. The library shall contain all the different modules and tools required for different tasks present in the fields of applied mathematics, engineering and science in general, and shall be based on methods and algorithms which could gurantee the most efficient and smoothest execution.
# Rules for Contribution
We focus of quality of your coding skills both from computer science and mathematics point of view. Key rules include.</br>
* You can contibute any algorithm you feel needs to be added in form of Code(C++),logic(any format),pseudo-code(any format)
* Some proof of its worst case time complexity (any format we accept your handwritten proof till your writing is not as bad as mine)
* Proof of space complexeity of algorithm (any format as described above)
* Proof of average time complexity of algorithm (as usual any format)
* Obviously C++ of algorithms which are have all required proofs and annalysis
* Feedback and modified code to make the current better
* Test cases to test certain codes
</br>
After the required condition of all necessary analysis described above and testing your code to extremes your code is finally added to our library. With proper credits to all the contributors. 
</br>
Note that in case you are contributing from some resource it is mendatory to add the source name in your file and later add the proper citation to refrences.md file in the repository
