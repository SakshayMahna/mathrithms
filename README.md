# Overview
This is a research project which aims to create a mathematical library for the C++ language, on the lines of NumPy and SciPy present in Python. The library shall contain all the different modules and tools required for different tasks present in the fields of applied mathematics, engineering and science in general, and shall be based on methods and algorithms which could gurantee the most efficient and smoothest execution.
# Rules for Contribution
We focus of quality of your coding skills both from computer science and mathematics point of view. Key rules include. <\br>
* You can contibute any algorithm you feel needs to be added in form of Code(C++),logic(any format),pseudo-code(any format)
* Some proof of its worst case time complexity (any format we accept your handwritten proof till your writing is not as bad as mine)
* Proof of space complexeity of algorithm (any format as described above)
* Proof of average time complexity of algorithm (as usual any format)
